# Wardland Compositor

This project is the implementation of a Wayland compositor using the tutorial provided the lead maintainer of sway (https://drewdevault.com/2018/02/17/Writing-a-Wayland-compositor-1.html)

The aim is to gain an indepth understanding of the Linux display stack and a useful contributor to Mutter and Weston

This will also allow me to make an informed decision on my view of the direction of the Linux display stack (i.e. X.org or Wayland)

Watch this space...
