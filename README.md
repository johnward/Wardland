# Wardland Compositor

This project is the implementation of a Wayland compositor for use in a custom Linux display stack. The aim is to gain an indepth understanding of the Linux display stack and a useful contributor to Mutter, Weston, wlroots etc.

This will also allow me to make an informed decision on my view of the direction of the Linux display stack (i.e. X.org or Wayland)
